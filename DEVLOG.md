**Project**: AI Chatbot for LùnPetShop Pet Store  
**Framework**: LangGraph  
**Date Started**: October 25, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ MVP Complete

## 🎯 The Vision

Building a bilingual (Vietnamese/English) AI chatbot to help customers of LùnPetShop in Đà Nẵng, Vietnam find products and information about their pet store. The chatbot, named "KittyCat," needed to be friendly, knowledgeable, and accessible via a modern chat widget on their website.

## 📋 Initial Requirements Analysis

### Core Questions to Answer
From the PRD, we identified 5 essential capabilities:
1. What products do you have for my cat?
2. What products do you have for my dog?
3. What can you tell me about the business?
4. What's your address?
5. How can I reach you on Zalo?

### Key Features
- **Bilingual Support**: Auto-detect and switch between Vietnamese/English
- **Product Knowledge**: 200+ products across 15+ categories
- **Business Info**: Store details, hours, contact information
- **Modern UI**: Gold/Yellow + Dark Blue theme matching brand
- **Memory**: Conversation history across multiple messages
- **Mobile-First**: Expandable chat widget design

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Why LangGraph?

After reviewing the latest LangGraph documentation, we chose it for:
- **State Management**: Built-in conversation state with `MessagesState`
- **Memory**: `MemorySaver` checkpointer for persistent conversations
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add nodes and control conversation flow
- **Modern API**: Latest patterns from LangGraph 0.2.28
- **Production Ready**: Robust framework used by major companies

### Tech Stack

**Backend**:
- **LangGraph**: Conversation orchestration and state management
- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast Python web framework
- **xAI Grok**: LLM for intelligent responses (OpenAI-compatible API)
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management

**Frontend**:
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework overhead, fast and responsive
- **Modern CSS**: CSS Grid, Flexbox, animations
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design from the ground up

**Tooling**:
- **uv**: Fast Python package installer
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

---

## 💡 Key Implementation Decisions

### 1. Hybrid Response System

Instead of relying solely on the LLM, we implemented a hybrid approach:

```python
def classify_intent(text, language):
    """Classify user intent based on keywords."""
    # Cat products, dog products, business info, contact
    # Falls back to LLM for general conversation
```

**Why?**
- **Faster responses** for common queries (no API call needed)
- **Consistent answers** for factual information
- **Cost effective** (fewer API calls)
- **Still intelligent** for edge cases and follow-ups

### 2. Language Detection

Implemented simple but effective language detection:

```python
def detect_language(text):
    """Detect Vietnamese vs English."""
    # Check for Vietnamese-specific characters (ă, â, đ, ê, ô, ơ, ư)
    # Check for Vietnamese keywords (xin, chào, sản phẩm, mèo, chó)
    # Default to English if no markers found
```

**Why not a library?**
- For our use case (2 languages), simple heuristics work perfectly
- No additional dependencies
- Fast and deterministic

### 3. State Design

Extended LangGraph's `MessagesState`:

```python
class ChatbotState(MessagesState):
    language: str = "vi"  # Track detected language
```

**Why?**
- Maintain language context across turns
- Simple and clean
- Works seamlessly with LangGraph's checkpoint system

### 4. Knowledge Base Structure

Organized as Python dictionaries in `knowledge_base.py`:

```python
CAT_PRODUCTS = {
    "food": {"vi": "Thức ăn cho Mèo", "en": "Cat Food", "count": 31},
    # ... more categories
}
```

**Why not a database?**
- MVP doesn't need database complexity
- Fast access (in-memory)
- Easy to update
- Version controlled with code
- Can easily migrate to DB later

## 🎨 UI/UX Decisions

### Chat Widget Design

**Expandable Button**:
- 60px circular button with 🐱 emoji
- Bottom-right corner (standard chat widget position)
- Smooth scale animation on hover

**Chat Window**:
- 380x600px (mobile-optimized dimensions)
- Dark theme (matches pet store vibe)
- Gold accents (#FFC107) for brand consistency
- Modern shadows and rounded corners

**Quick Actions**:
- 4 pre-defined buttons for common questions
- Hidden after first message
- Reduces friction for first-time users

**Language Toggle**:
- Prominent button in header
- Shows current language (VI/EN)
- One-click switching

### Color Psychology

**Gold/Yellow (#FFC107)**:
- Warmth and friendliness
- Associated with happiness and pets
- High visibility for CTAs

**Dark Blue/Black**:
- Premium feel
- Good contrast for readability
- Modern and professional

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **LangGraph Documentation**: The latest docs were comprehensive and up-to-date. Reading them first saved significant debugging time.

2. **Hybrid Approach**: Combining rule-based responses with LLM intelligence gave us the best of both worlds - fast, consistent answers for common queries, and flexibility for edge cases.

3. **Simple Language Detection**: Our heuristic approach works perfectly for the bilingual use case. Sometimes simple is better than complex.

4. **uv Package Manager**: Significantly faster than pip. Installation took seconds instead of minutes.

5. **TypedDict for State**: Using Python's type system with LangGraph's state management made the code clean and IDE-friendly.

### Challenges Overcome

1. **API Compatibility**: xAI's Grok uses OpenAI-compatible API, so we used `ChatOpenAI` with custom base_url. Worked seamlessly.

2. **State Management**: Initially considered complex state schemas, but realized `MessagesState` with a language field was sufficient.

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Chat widget needed special handling for small screens. Used CSS media queries to make it fullscreen on phones.

### What We'd Do Differently

1. **Structured Product Data**: If scaling, would move to a proper database with search capabilities.

2. **More Granular Intent Classification**: Could add more intent categories for better routing.

3. **Analytics**: Would add tracking for popular questions and user flows.
